HINT: search for TODO in the files to find things to check.

In VarDef.f90:
- Why not use a single matrix for barycenter coords?
- Defined nu as kinematic viscosity coefficient, but never using it.
- Found a commented chs, but just in this file. We don't need it, right?

In main.f90:
 - Try thinking about a solution using a single matrix, for eample using a matrix of dimensions IMAX*2+1 * JMAX*2+1
   and indices for both axis with step 2 (note the sparse form of the matrix, is it possible a better solution?).
   By the way, at the moment I think the 2 vectors solution is faster and also lighter in memory terms.
