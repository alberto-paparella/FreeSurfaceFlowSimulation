# Free Surface Flow Simulation on Structured Grids

Aim of this project is the simulation of a fluid dynamic phenomena, that is the free surface flow on structured grids. Thanks to this simulation, we are capable of observe the variation over the depth of the water in each point of the considered domain during time, starting from a given condition, as well as the evolution of speed in each point among both axis.

The simulation can be executed making exploiting any number of processors given that the computation matrix is divisible for such number. This parallelisation allows to reduce the computation time, as proven by the speed-up analysis, efficiency analysis and Kuck function analysis at the varying of the number of used processors.
